Netflix Content Strategy Analysis Project
Project Overview
This project analyzes Netflix's content strategy by exploring the dataset of Netflix releases in 2023. The objective is to derive meaningful insights, identify trends, and evaluate how different factors (e.g., content type, language, release date) impact viewership. The project also includes an exploration of seasonality, day-of-week trends, and potential correlations with holidays.

Dataset
File Name: netflix_content_2023.csv
Description: Contains information about Netflix's 2023 content releases, including:
Title
Content Type (e.g., Movie, TV Show)
Language Indicator
Release Date
Hours Viewed (in billions)

Project Goals
Analyze viewership patterns:
Compare Movies and TV Shows.
Examine trends based on language, release month, and seasons.
Identify top-performing content:
Find titles with the highest viewership.
Understand temporal trends:
Analyze release patterns by month and weekday.
Explore viewership impact near significant holidays.
Build insights for future strategies:
Suggest optimal release times and focus areas based on data.

Pipeline Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing
Convert Hours Viewed into numerical format.
Parse Release Date and extract:
Release Month
Release Day
Release Season (Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall)
Map content releases near significant holidays.
2. Data Analysis and Visualization
Content Trends:
Analyze total viewership hours for Movies vs. TV Shows.
Language-based Viewership:
Identify the most popular languages.
Seasonality:
Visualize viewership across months and seasons.
Day-of-Week Patterns:
Evaluate the impact of weekday releases on viewership.
Holiday Impact:
Highlight content released near significant holidays and their viewership.
3. Outputs
Top-Performing Content:
A table showing the top 5 titles based on viewership.
Visualizations:
Bar plots, line graphs, and dual-axis plots for trends and comparisons.
Summary Insights:
Recommendations for optimal release strategies.
